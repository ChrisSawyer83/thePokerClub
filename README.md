# thePokerClub
This repository consists of smart contracts for use in running a large public Poker Club as a DAO on the Ethereum blockchain. 
Everything contained here is hypothetical and meant to exist as part of my Solidity Developer portfolio.

Contracts in this repository are as follows.

1. Membership.sol - storage contract for the creation of new members
2. Results.sol - storage contract for wins and losses
3. Proposals.sol - voting contract for proposed rule changes
